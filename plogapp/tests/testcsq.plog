%random block problem
%This a model for the random placement of blocks,

%which serve as obstacles, on the location of a map,

%and the resulting accessiblility relation among the locations.

%In this problem, there are 5 locations and one block a.

sorts

#location= 1..2.
#block={1}.
#bool = {true, false}.
%The domain contains only one random attributes
%which says the block is at some location
attributes

place:#block -> #location.
leftof: #location, #location -> #bool.
belowof: #location, #location -> #bool.
invalid: #bool.
connected: #location, #location ->#bool.
blocked: #location -> #bool.

%The grid is desribed by the relation leftof(location, location) and belowof(location, cation)

% 1 -- 2 -- 3

%      4 -- 5

statements



connected(1,2) :- connected(2,1).
connected(2,1) :- connected(1,2).
connected(1,2)=false :- not connected(1,2).


%connected(1,2) :- not blocked(1).
%blocked(1).
 



%if some location has the block, it is blocked


%The endof the program
