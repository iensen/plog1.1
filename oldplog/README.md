This is the P-log originally implemented by Weijun Zhu. 

The original source files are here: http://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/research/krlab/plog.php

I am using it here for testing purposes only.

While the original distribution doesn't contain any copy right notes, I was orally told that the author allowed the distribution of this software under an open source license.
